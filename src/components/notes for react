notes for react

1. Differece between:
    <Suspense></Suspense> = "we use this if theres a child included inside"
    <Suspense/> = "w"e use this if there is no cild, possible: classname"
    
2. What is you API:
    "theres a  prebuilt API in react, such as hooks and components, ecample of this in our code is the useContent or useREF"
    
3. meaning of:
    x = "width"
    y = "height"
    z= "depth"
    
4. Use of BrowserRoute:
    "the use of BrowserRoute is to render high resolution, like 3d images of THREEJS, it support the HTML5"

5. const name {{index, icon, title}} :
    props thene declare it. coming from constant: userLink

6. no canvas loader aand noo section wrapper, di maayos ung nav hehe\

meaning sa ThreeJs:

1. ambient light with intensity 0.4, this will give a moderate and uniform lighting across the scene. that will prevent the model to blend much into the background.

2. hemisphere light with intensity 0.15 and ground color of black - this is the light for top and bottom. 

3.  position={[ -20, 10, 10 ]} - highlight position, top to side
    angle={ 0.3 } - this keeps the light concentrated in specific part
    penumbra={ 1 } - give the a light a smooth transition texture
    castShadow
    shadow-mapSize= { 1024 }
    
4.  frameloop="demand" - it updates the frame if there is a change in the object, to save power.
    shadows is to enchance the realism of the object.
    dpr={[ 1, 2 ]} or (device pixel ration) - based ont the device screen, it helps managing performance
    gl={{ preserveDrawingBuffer: true }} - to minimize the use of memory 
    maxPolarAngle={ Math.PI / 2 }
    minPolarAngle={ 0.5 }

5. SectionWrapper(Lawyer, "lawyer-section"): This wraps the Lawyer component and passes the idName as "lawyer-section".

        
    Explanation
Check modelPath: By checking if modelPath contains the substring "helena" or "book", we can determine which model to render (HelenaCanvas or BookCanvas). This assumes that each modelâ€™s path has a unique identifier in the file name.

Rendering the Appropriate Canvas: Depending on the value in modelPath, this code will render HelenaCanvas if modelPath includes "helena" or BookCanvas if it includes "book".

Fallback: The null in the conditional chain ensures that if modelPath does not contain a recognized identifier, nothing is rendered.

tags are not working, it still needs to connect

anong pinagkaiba ng index sa styles? 
yung main layout dapat katabi ung app js or ibang file name kasi layout pang css.

Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'start' on 'SpeechRecognition': recognition has already started.
-This error occurs because mic.start() is called multiple times when isListening is true, causing the SpeechRecognition API to throw an InvalidStateError.
